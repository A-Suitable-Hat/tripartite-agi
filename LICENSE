================================================================================

This is a custom research license. It is more restrictive than standard open
source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) due to the prohibition on commercial use.

For standard definitions:
- "Commercial use" means any use primarily intended for or directed toward
  commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
- "Non-commercial" means use where there is no expectation of commercial
  advantage or monetary compensation.
- Academic institutions and non-profit research organizations are considered
  non-commercial for their research and educational activities.
