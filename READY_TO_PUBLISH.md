## Next Step: Publish to GitHub

### Quick Publish (30 minutes)

1. **Create Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `tripartite-agi`
   - Description: "Research implementation of a three-layer cognitive architecture for embodied AGI with multi-layer safety mechanisms"
   - Public repository
   - Don't initialize with README (you have one)

2. **Upload Files**
   ```bash
   cd tripartite-agi-repo

   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Tripartite AGI Architecture

   - Complete implementation (5,472 lines)
   - Non-Commercial Research License
   - Documentation and examples
   - Test suite (40+ assertions)"

   git remote add origin https://github.com/A-Suitable-Hat/tripartite-agi.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Configure Repository**
   - Add topics: `agi`, `cognitive-architecture`, `ai-safety`, `harm-ontology`, `embodied-ai`, `python`
   - Enable Issues (for peer support)

4. **Create Release** (Optional but recommended)
